Questionable
========================================
Why am I doing this? Good question, I was curious.

Context
========================================
To use what is saved. To reorder what is messed up.

Contents
========================================
1. Powershell scripts as original/fundamental scripts
2. Javascript as webpage event listeners, define logic paths
3. html as frontend page design.
4. PapaParse library is used for parsing CSV files, I do not own anything in that folder.

Contributing
========================================
This project, starting from a private one, we all know we won't be bothered with much of the code practices, so just do whatever you want as long as you don't destroy the code.
For issues, go assign them yourself, if you finish it close it yourself, need help send message/dms, don't mess up the system.
