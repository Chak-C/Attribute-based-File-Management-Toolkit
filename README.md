Questionable
========================================
Why am I doing this? Good question, I was curious.

Context / Aim
========================================
To use what is saved. To order what is messed up. To discover what may be forgotten.

Contents
========================================
1. Powershell scripts as original/fundamental scripts
2. Javascript as webpage event listeners, define logic paths
3. html, css as frontend page design.
4. PapaParse library is used for parsing CSV files, I do not own anything in that folder.

Contributing
========================================
This project, as a private one, is supposedly a practice repository for anyone to try anything on. Don't worry about the rigorous procedures people need to follow to push/pull changes. With full access to this private repo, explore everything without concerns.

Although, conventionally, a project should not be using too many languages due to maintainability and security concerns. This repository is designed to for practice usages only thus feel free to use any language convenient to you (as long as it can integrate with the purpose of the project. 

Below are the languages currently contained in this project (I know it says at the side but I'll still write it down to increase the word count)
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Powershell

I, or we, have aspirations to also introduce the following languages into the project in due time.
1. Java: For tokenizer/parser
2. SQL: For some csv file management and searching
3. Python: For edit distance/ search similarity functions

This project also has a default csv file for testing and using purposes, it is not present in the repository and will never be in any cloud-based paltform so if you want it please contact me for it.

Again, we all know we won't be bothered with much of the code practices, so just do whatever you want as long as you don't destroy the code.

For issues, go assign them yourself, if you finish it close it yourself, need help send message/dms, don't mess up the system.
