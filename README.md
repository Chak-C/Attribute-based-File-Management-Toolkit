Attribute-based File Management Toolkit
========================================
Generate a name for file based on the tags provided. Rename the file. Then the filter script would filter relevant information based on tags.

A very basic project utilising knowledge on PowerShell and JS. A lot of aspects in this project can be streamlined and improved. Feel free to list any suggestions as issues. 


Context / Aim
========================================
To utilize stored information, rectify disorganized elements and uncover potentially overlooked aspects in file explorer.

Contents
========================================
1. Powershell scripts as original/fundamental scripts
2. Javascript as webpage event listeners, define logic paths
3. html, css as frontend page design.
4. PapaParse library is used for parsing CSV files, I do not own anything in that folder.

Contributing
========================================
This project is a practice repository for me to test and apply ideas. 

Authorized contributors will have full access to this repository, explore everything without concerns.

Conventionally, a project should not be using too many languages due to maintainability and security concerns. This repository is designed to for practice usages only 
thus feel free to use any language convenient to you (as long as it can integrate with the purpose of the project). 

Below are the languages currently contained in this project (I know it says at the side but I'll still write it down to increase the word count)
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Powershell

I, or we, have aspirations to also introduce the following languages into the project in due time.
1. Java: For tokenizer/parser
2. SQL: For further csv file management and searching
3. Python: For edit distance/ search similarity functions

This project also has a default csv file for testing and using purposes, it is not present in the repository so if you want it please contact me for it.

Again, this project is open ended so everything is allowed as long as root code aren't destroyed.

For issues, raise, assign and finish them however you will. If finished then close it yourself, need help send message/dms, don't mess up the system.
